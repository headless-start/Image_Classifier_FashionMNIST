# Fashion MNIST Image Classification  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the **loading, preprocessing, and visualization** of the **Fashion MNIST dataset** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The dataset consists of grayscale images of fashion items, each labeled with one of ten classes. The project prepares the dataset for training machine learning models to classify fashion items into their respective categories.  

**Dataset**: Fashion MNIST  
**Images**: 28x28 pixel grayscale images of fashion items (e.g., T-shirts, shoes, dresses).  
**Classes**: 10 categories of clothing items:  
1. T-shirt/top  
2. Trouser  
3. Pullover  
4. Dress  
5. Coat  
6. Sandal  
7. Shirt  
8. Sneaker  
9. Bag  
10. Ankle boot

## üöÄ Key Features  
1. **Loading the Dataset**:  
   - The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using the `keras.datasets.fashion_mnist` API.  
   - Training set: 60,000 images.  
   - Test set: 10,000 images.  
2. **Preprocessing the Data**:  
   - Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.  
   - Images are prepared for visualization and model input.  
3. **Visualization**:  
   - Display the first image from the training dataset.  
   - Show a 5x5 grid of the first 25 training images with their corresponding labels.  
4. **Labels**:  
   - Labels represent the type of clothing item in each image (e.g., 0: T-shirt/top, 1: Trouser, 2: Pullover, etc.).

## üîç How It Works  
1. **Loading the Dataset**:  
   - The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in API.  
2. **Preprocessing**:  
   - Normalize pixel values to improve model training efficiency.  
3. **Visualization**:  
   - Display individual images and grids of images with labels for better understanding.

## üìä Sample Visualizations  
1. **First Image in the Dataset**:  
   - The first image from the training set is displayed with a color bar, showing raw pixel data.  
2. **Grid of 25 Training Images**:  
   - A 5x5 grid of the first 25 training images is displayed, with each image labeled according to its class (e.g., T-shirt, trouser, dress).

## üõ† System Requirements  
1. **Python**: 3.6+  
2. **TensorFlow**: 2.x (Ensure compatibility with cuDNN library.)  
3. **TensorFlow Datasets**: For loading the dataset.  
4. **Matplotlib**: For visualization.  
5. **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.  
6. **TensorFlow Docs**: Optional for advanced visualization.
