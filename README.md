Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This project demonstrates the loading, preprocessing, and visualization of the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It prepares the dataset for training machine learning models to classify fashion items into different categories. The dataset consists of grayscale images of clothing items, and each image is labeled with one of ten classes.
